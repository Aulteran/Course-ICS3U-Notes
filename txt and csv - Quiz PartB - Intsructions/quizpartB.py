# You have been asked to create a databasing system for a car dealership. In their system they need 
# 1)	The ability to add cars to database once they arrive
# 2)	Remove Cars from the database once they are purchased
# 3)	Change the price on cars as they devalue
# 4)	See the entire database, and all the cars on the lot.
# Please create a program (in Python â€“ no GUI) that allows the car dealership to work through these problems
# in the database.
# Database: 
# [ID || MAKE || MODEL || YEAR]
