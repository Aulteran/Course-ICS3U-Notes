# Mr. Petrella is looking to create a program to help him tabulate the marks of an assignment that he has 
# marked. He comes to you looking for help. In this assignment you must have the following criteria:
# 1) Ask the total number of students
# 2) Ask the Total Assignment Value (what is it out of?) ie. 10
# 3) Ask the mark the student received (For each student) ie. 6
# 4) Calculate the percentage for each student (using step 2 & 3) ie. 60%
# 5) Store the averages in a container
# 6) Display the results of the class
# 7) Have the program calculate the mean, median, and mode of the entire class
# University LEVEL ADD-ON:
# 8) Have the program able to call and display a student gradeâ€™s by inputting their name
